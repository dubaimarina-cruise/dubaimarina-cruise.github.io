And when it comes to cruising, there is nothing that could beat the grandeur of Dubai Marina Cruise. If you do not have much idea about Dhow Cruise Dubai Marina and what it is all about, then this blog post is going to give you a glimpse into the same.</p><p>If you actually do not know what a dhow is, then let me brief you that it is a wooden ship in Arab that was used in the Bedouin era. This boat was used to sail through the trading routes for the import and export of pearls and fish. Now, modern and advanced boats have replaced the dhows but these dhows are actually playing a great role in keeping the Bedouin tradition alive. To enjoy this unique experience, you should also book your ticket for your <a href="https://deserttsafaridubai.ae/dubai-marina-cruise"><strong>Dubai Marina cruise</strong></a>.</p><p>Dubai Marina is the scenic hub of Dubai city and cruising alongside it will sure to give you immense joy.</p><p><strong>Why pick Marina Cruise Dubai? </strong></p><p>If you are wondering why should you pick Dubai Marina for cruising, then you should note that it takes you on a journey through the breathtaking Palm Jumeirah and Bluewaters Islands. Particularly speaking about the dhow, it is well-equipped with plush and comfortable seating, comes with soft lighting, and you also get great hospitality while you are relaxing on the deck and enjoying the breathtaking view.</p><p>While you are cruising alongside Marina, you can also enjoy a delicious buffet dinner. You can enjoy this delicious meal alongside fresh evening freeze, flavorsome food with Arabian music, and captivating dance performances. The scenic beauty will go to its full peak as the evening approaches.</p><p><strong>Timing and Pricing of Dubai Marina Cruise</strong></p><p>The Dubai Marina Cruise starts in the evening and the dhow will depart from the set location around 5 pm if you have chosen the sunset cruises. On the other hand, if you have chosen dinner cruises, your cruise will depart around 8 pm. Now, talking about the cost of the cruise you will be charged, it will completely depend on one factor- the package you have chosen. The price for this package is usually AED 140 per person, but as I said it will depend on the chosen package.</p><p>The Dubai Marina Cruise usually departs from the Dubai Marina Yacht Club and will take around 2 hours to complete. This provides you with a treat to the eyes as you sail alongside the breathtaking view of Dubai&#x27;s skyline, Ain Dubai which is the world&#x27;s largest observatory wheel, and other locations.</p><p><strong>Dress code and best time to visit Dubai Marina Cruise </strong></p><p>If you are planning to visit Dubai, then the primary thing that you need to take into consideration is the weather of the city. Hot and humid climatic conditions may downgrade your experience in the city. So, we recommend you to visit the place during those months that are cooler. Yes, you can plan your trip between November to April when the weather is pleasant and you&#x27;ll get to witness the stunning skyline of the city during the night.</p><p>Particularly speaking about the dress code for the Dubai Marina Cruise, please make sure that you wear modest clothes. In most public or tourist places in Dubai, you are recommended to cover your knees and shoulders. Make sure that you do not wear any revealing clothes. If you are taking on the cruise journey during winter, please understand that it could get quite windy at night, so wear the clothes accordingly. And with this, we come to the end of our blog where I have given crucial details about the Dubai Marina Dhow cruise.</p><p><strong>Conclusion: </strong></p><p>Through this article, we have tried to carry out a discussion on different aspects of the Dubai Marina cruise. Knowing these details well in advance could save you a lot of time and will help in the decision-making as well. We also recommend you pre-book your tickets so that you can avoid the last-minute hassle and enjoy your <a href="https://deserttsafaridubai.ae/dubai-city-tour"><strong>Dubai City Tour</strong></a> in the best possible ways.
